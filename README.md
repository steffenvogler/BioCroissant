# 🥐 BioCroissant - data sharing for the future of biomedical AI  
BioCroissant is an open, lightweight, and extensible standard for describing biomedical datasets so they can be **found**, **understood**, **shared**, and **reused** — securely and responsibly.

Built with real-world clinical, research, and regulatory needs in mind, BioCroissant bridges the gap between **ML engineers**, **healthcare professionals**, and **policy makers** working to build trustworthy national and international health data spaces.

## 🚀 Why BioCroissant?

Modern biomedical AI relies on high‑quality, interoperable data - but today’s datasets are often siloed, inconsistent, or poorly documented.

BioCroissant provides:

- **A simple, structured schema** for describing biomedical datasets  
- **Built‑in FAIR alignment** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)  
- **Compatibility with national & cross-border health data space initiatives**  
- **Seamless integration with ML workflows** (clean metadata, easy parsing, validation tooling)  
- **Governance-friendly metadata** supporting transparency, reproducibility, and clinical trust  

If you are building models, conducting clinical research, or shaping data policy, BioCroissant helps ensure your data is **ready for science**, **ready for AI**, and **ready for regulation**.

## 👩‍💻 Who Is This For?

### **ML Developers & Data Scientists**
